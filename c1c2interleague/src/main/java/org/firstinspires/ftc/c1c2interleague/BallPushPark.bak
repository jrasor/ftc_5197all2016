/**
 * This file illustrates the concept of driving a path based on encoder counts.
 *
 * Autonomous mode for Blue team, pushes Blue Cap Ball off Center Vortex base
 *   and parks partially there.
 *
 * Version history:
 *   2/7/17 Yehya Nasser v 0.1: a little short and rather slow. Place Sliderbot with
 *     right rear corner exactly 2 tiles from near left corner of Blue Wall, or
 *     exactly 4 tiles from Blue Corner Vortex. Aim it straight at the Cap Ball.
 *   2/9/17 Yahya v 0.2. Faster, better, still a little short. Sometimes Blue misses
 *     park. JMR refactored to rename to BallPushPark; it runs for both Alliances.
 *   2/9/17 Yehya Nasser v 1.0: Production code. Added two more inches to push ball
 *     and park partially on center platform.
